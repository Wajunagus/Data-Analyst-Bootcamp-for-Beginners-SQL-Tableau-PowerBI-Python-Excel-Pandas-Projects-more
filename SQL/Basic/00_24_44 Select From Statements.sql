Distinct

When we use distinct, we're actually saying that we want the unique values in a specific column.

Everything should be returned, so all 9 rows should be returned, & thats coz every single 1 of these are unique.

-- So, there's only going to be 2 results, the male & the female. And that's coz there's only 2 distinct values in that column.

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Count

Count is going to show us all the Non Null values in a column.
        
All that it's going to give us is a count of 9, coz we have 9 last names.
If for whatever reason somebody's last name was left out, & that was null,
then it would have returned maybe 8 or 7 depending on how many were actually in there.
If an entire column was null, it would be returned 0.
